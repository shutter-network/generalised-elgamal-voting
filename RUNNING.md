# Running Shutter Governance Protocol — deployment guide

Shutter Governance Protocol works over interchangeable data-layer backends; a deployment **picks a
backend** and every service is unchanged. Three compose stacks:

| Backend | Compose file | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Database** (Postgres) | `deploy/docker-compose.db.yml` | Validated end-to-end (register → DKG → vote → tally) |
| **Blockchain** (Anvil devnet) | `deploy/docker-compose.chain-devnet.yml` | Validated: `tests/test_services_chain_daemon_e2e.py` runs this exact topology (coordinator relay + keyper HTTP servers writing to it + read-only data-layer service + coordinator DKG-over-HTTP + chain-direct admin + API ballot ingest) over Anvil to a correct on-chain tally; also driven by hand through a full election |
| **Blockchain** (real chain) | `deploy/docker-compose.chain.yml` | Same topology, external RPC + pre-deployed registry, no devnet tools. Config-only difference from the devnet stack |

**Attaching to an external data layer.** Those three stacks each run their own data
layer. When the data layer belongs to someone else — another system storing the
artifacts and serving the port contract over HTTP — run
`deploy/docker-compose.coordinator.yml` instead: the coordinator alone, pointed at that
URL with `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_DATA_LAYER_URL`, with no postgres, data-layer, api or admin service. The
keypers are unchanged (`deploy/docker-compose.keyper*.yml`); they read the external data
layer's `/port` mount via `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_API_URL` and relay their writes through the coordinator
exactly as they do on the bundled stacks. Nothing in the code is aware of the
difference: `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_DATA_LAYER=database` has always meant "speak the port contract over
HTTP", and this only packages that configuration.

The automated test suite (`pytest`) is the integration test across all three
backends — in-memory, Postgres-over-HTTP, and blockchain-over-Anvil — including
the multi-operator HTTP keyper path. These composes are for **operating** the
system, not for testing correctness.

## Updating an existing deployment

The package is now named `shutter-governance-protocol`. Python imports and service
commands use `shutter_governance_protocol`, and frontend workspaces use the
`@shutter-governance-protocol` scope. Reinstall the Python package and frontend
dependencies after updating your checkout.

Use the `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_` prefix for protocol environment variables.
Update operator environment files using the templates in `deploy/`, and rebuild
service images. Compose project names and the example database credentials also
use the new name. Existing database volumes keep their original credentials;
point the new configuration at those credentials and volumes when keeping data.

Request signatures, keyper bootstrap messages, and wallet eligibility challenges
now use the new protocol name. Update the Python services, browser apps, and
contracts together. Previously signed requests and bootstrap messages do not
verify under the new labels, so generate fresh signatures and bootstrap tokens.
The eligibility service's default pseudonym secret also changes when no explicit
secret is configured. Keep an explicit `ELIGIBILITY_PSEUDONYM_SECRET` when
preserving voter pseudonyms across an update. Finish active elections using their
original components before switching to this version.

## Architecture

```
  ADMIN / OPERATOR STACK                              KEYPER STACKS (one per operator)
  admin / api (ballot ingest) ─▶ data-layer ─▶ DB|Chain      keyper 1
                                     ▲ reads                  keyper 2   ◀─ driven over HTTP by
  coordinator ────────────────────┘ writes (relays)  ◀──────▶ keyper 3      the coordinator
  (sole keyper bootstrapper; drives DKG + tally;             (hold only their own key)
   publishes the result)
```

- **Keypers run as separate stacks**, one per operator — `docker-compose.keyper.yml`
  runs the published image, `docker-compose.keyper.build.yml` builds from this
  checkout; this guide uses the latter.
  No shared Docker network. The coordinator reaches each by the URL in the election config
  (public, or `host.docker.internal` locally).
- **Database backend** — every component speaks HTTP to the one data-layer service, which
  verifies the caller's signature and writes to Postgres. Keypers POST signed writes to the
  coordinator, which relays them.
- **Blockchain backend** — authorization is by tx sender: admin (`ADMIN_SIGNING_KEY`) and
  the API ballot ingest (`GATEWAY_SIGNING_KEY`) submit their own txs. Keypers hold no chain
  key — they content-sign writes; the coordinator (`COORDINATOR_SIGNING_KEY`) pays gas, sends
  the `...Signed` tx (contract `ecrecover`s the keyper) and `publishResult` (it holds
  `RESULT_PUBLISHER_ROLE`). The data-layer service is read-only.

Identities are secp256k1 keys for write authorization (admin/gateway/coordinator/keyper).
Voter ballot + attestation keys are separate — Schnorr-G1, client-side.

# End-to-end walkthrough

Run commands from the repository root. Install Python 3.11+ and the project
(`pip install -e '.[dev,db,chain,keyper]'`), Docker with Compose, and Node.js/npm
before starting. For the blockchain devnet, also install Foundry and initialise
the contract submodules (`git submodule update --init --recursive`).

Follow the steps in order — later steps depend on earlier services being up. Frontend steps
(5, 6, 8) are browser interactions; everything else is copy-paste.

## 0. Generate identities and envs

```bash
python scripts/gen_deploy_env.py
# writes deploy/.env + .env.eligibility + .env.keyper{1,2,3}
```

Writes (all git-ignored, split by concern): `deploy/.env` (operator stack),
`deploy/.env.eligibility` (issuer key + config), and `deploy/.env.keyper{1,2,3}` (each
keyper). See the matching `deploy/*.example` files.

This is a **local-dev generator**: operator EOAs are the pre-funded Anvil accounts [0..2]
(already hold ETH on the devnet; harmless on db). These keys are public — a real deploy
supplies its own funded keys and never uses this env against a real chain.

## 1. Start the three keypers

Keypers must be up **before** an election is registered, so the coordinator can reach them
for the DKG. Each runs as its own compose project (separate network, mirroring real
machines):

```bash
for n in 1 2 3; do
  docker compose -p keyper$n -f deploy/docker-compose.keyper.build.yml --env-file deploy/.env.keyper$n up -d --build
done
```

Confirm all three are reachable — each `/status` returns that keyper's `address` (its 20-byte
EOA, the value the register form resolves in step 5):

```bash
for p in 8101 8102 8103; do echo -n "keyper :$p → "; curl -s http://localhost:$p/status || echo unreachable; echo; done
```

Real operator (own machine): fill your own env, run one
```bash
cp deploy/.env.keyper.example deploy/.env.keyper
# Run the published image version
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.keyper.yml --env-file deploy/.env.keyper up -d
```
> Onboarding is one-time: give the admin your keyper's **public URL** (→ `config.keypers[].url`)
> and receive `COORDINATOR_IDENTITY` out of band; tokens are installed automatically over the
> signed `/auth/bootstrap` channel.

## 2. Start a stack (database or blockchain)

Pick one. Both bring up: data-layer, coordinator, api (reads + ballot ingest), admin.

```bash
# Database (Postgres):
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.db.yml --env-file deploy/.env up --build -d

# Blockchain (Anvil devnet) — compile contracts first; the registry is AUTO-DEPLOYED on `up`
# (deterministic address the services default to — no separate step, no pasting an address):
(cd contracts && forge build)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.chain-devnet.yml --env-file deploy/.env up --build -d
```

> **Real chain** — identical to the devnet stack, but with `deploy/docker-compose.chain.yml`
> (no `anvil`, no auto `deploy-registry`, 30-second coordinator polls).
> **Prerequisite, one-time out of band:**
> deploy the `ElectionRegistry` once (`scripts/deploy_registry.py`) and set
> `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`, fund admin/gateway/coordinator with real ETH, and set
> `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_CHAIN_RPC` — all in `deploy/.env`. Then
> `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.chain.yml --env-file deploy/.env up -d --build`.

## 3. Start the eligibility service (+ whitelist)

The issuer runs standalone with its **own** env file. The bundled service is a **dummy** that
grants everyone by default.

**To whitelist specific addresses** (deny everyone else): edit
`deploy/eligibility-allowlist.json` — a `{address: weight}` map (Anvil [3..6] are pre-filled
as examples) — then set `ELIGIBILITY_ALLOWLIST=/app/eligibility-allowlist.json` in
`deploy/.env.eligibility` and start the service:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.eligibility.yml --env-file deploy/.env.eligibility up --build -d
```

The file is re-read **per `/attest` request**, so you can add/remove wallets live (no
restart). An unlisted wallet gets `403` and no ballot is built. Unset the var → allow-all.

## 4. Start both frontends

```bash
npm --prefix frontend install                        # once
cp frontend/apps/admin/.env.example frontend/apps/admin/.env    # once (edit if ports differ)
cp frontend/apps/voter/.env.example frontend/apps/voter/.env    # once
npm --prefix frontend run dev:admin                  # http://localhost:5173
npm --prefix frontend run dev:voter                  # http://localhost:5174
```

Both apps are backend-blind (they read the public API on `:8500`). The admin app also talks
to the admin service (`:8300`) and the eligibility issuer (`:8600`).

## 5. Register the election (admin app)

In the admin app (`:5173`): connect the **admin wallet** (MetaMask — its account is the admin
EOA), fill the guided form, and register. Each action is authorized by a wallet signature (no
token); the form verifies the entered eligibility public key against the running issuer's
`/health` before signing. On chain, the service fires the register tx as the admin EOA
(`msg.sender == adminAddr`). Fill the election config and choose a suitable voting window.

**Form values for this local walkthrough** — all fixed public dev values from
`gen_deploy_env.py` (it also prints them):

- **Threshold** — `t = 2`, `n = 3` (two of three keypers must cooperate; `t` is the quorum).
- **Keypers** — add three, one URL per line (the form resolves each address from its
  `/status`):
  ```
  http://host.docker.internal:8101
  http://host.docker.internal:8102
  http://host.docker.internal:8103
  ```
- **Eligibility signer** — a BLS public key (not an EOA), paste in full (fixed dev value;
  also in `deploy/.env.eligibility` or `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8600/health`):
  ```
  0xa854a5ed41899e4927f256fea44a44c95d1a1a611989d1345d3fb7a971f51d2b1922694d9e66a31c1c82594763db9baf
  ```
- **Result-publisher address** — the coordinator (it publishes the result):
  `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC` (Anvil [2]).
- **Blockchain stack only:**
  - **Vote-proxy address** — the gateway (the API's on-chain ballot sender):
    `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8` (Anvil [1]).
  - **Self-submit fee** — the per-election fee for a voter self-paying their own `submitVote`
    (ETH); use `0` for fee-free. These two fields are hidden on the database stack.

Watch the DKG run in the logs (use your stack's compose file):

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.db.yml --env-file deploy/.env logs -f coordinator
docker compose -p keyper1 -f deploy/docker-compose.keyper.build.yml --env-file deploy/.env.keyper1 logs -f
```

Once the coordinator finishes key generation, the finalized election key is readable (`00..01` = first election):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8500/elections/1/dkg/finalized
```

OR you can see it on the dashboard.

## 6. Cast votes (voter app)

Once the election is `Voting` (i.e. past `voting_start`) with a finalized key, open the voter
app (`:5174`), connect a **whitelisted** wallet (from step 3), pick the election, enter the
vote vector, and cast. The app fetches a credential from the eligibility service (`/attest`)
and submits the ballot to the public API — the ballot is built entirely in the browser. A
voter may re-cast until the window closes. With the default `last-wins` policy,
the valid ballot with the highest credential nonce counts. With `first-wins`,
the lowest nonce counts instead; see the replay note below.

## 7. Wait for voting end → aggregate & decrypt

After `voting_end` the coordinator drives the tally automatically: it triggers the keypers to
aggregate (agreement from `t` keypers makes the aggregate canonical), then to decrypt, recovers the result, and publishes it.
Watch it happen:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.db.yml --env-file deploy/.env logs -f coordinator
docker compose -p keyper1 -f deploy/docker-compose.keyper.build.yml --env-file deploy/.env.keyper1 logs -f
```

## 8. Verify the final tally

Open the dashboard in either frontend — it shows the published totals per candidate. To
confirm from the API directly (totals reflect the ballots cast, each scaled by its
eligibility-attested weight):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8500/elections/1/result
#   → {"result":{"totals":[...],"keyperIndices":[1,2],"bsgsBound":...,...}}
```

## Teardown

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.db.yml --env-file deploy/.env down -v # or chain-devnet.yml
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.eligibility.yml --env-file deploy/.env.eligibility down -v
for n in 1 2 3; do docker compose -p keyper$n -f deploy/docker-compose.keyper.build.yml --env-file deploy/.env.keyper$n down; done
rm -rf postgres-data keyper-state* coordinator-state eligibility-state   # bind-mounted state at repo root
# postgres-data is db-stack only and holds the elections DB.
```

# Reference

### Ports
| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| data-layer | 8000 — **internal only**, not published to the host |
| keypers | separate stacks (local: 8101–8103) |
| admin | 8300 |
| coordinator | 8400 |
| public API (reads + ballot ingest) | 8500 — also serves the port read surface at `/port` |
| eligibility (standalone) | 8600 |
| admin app (dev) / voter app (dev) | 5173 / 5174 |

**Two read shapes on :8500 — which to curl.** The browser routes (`/elections/1/…`) take
the friendly decimal id and are what the frontends use, so they are the ones to reach for
when eyeballing an election by hand (the curls above). They are *display-shaped*: election
ids are decimalized and ballot pages cap at 200. The `/port` routes
(`/port/elections/<64-hex>/…`) are the byte-verbatim `ElectionDataLayer` contract —
bare-hex ids and ballot storage metadata. Port ballot pages are capped at 1,000
records; request a positive `count` and advance `start` until all records are read. Use `/port` when the bytes matter
(re-deriving a digest, verifying a signature, reading every ballot) and when writing a
client that speaks the port; that is what keypers point `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_API_URL` at.

### Operational notes

**Re-votes & replay protection.** The eligibility service stamps each credential with a
monotonic per-(election, pseudonym) **nonce**, persisted in `ELIGIBILITY_NONCE_DB` (on the
`eligibility-state` bind mount). Two defenses use it: (1) the **tally** keeps only the
highest-nonce valid ballot per voter for `last-wins`, or the lowest for
`first-wins`, with storage order breaking ties; (2) the **API ingest** rejects a
nonce `≤` the highest it finds among the latest 1,000 stored ballots
(`400 STALE_OR_REPLAYED`). This bounded scan is a best-effort funds/DoS filter.
The nonce is inside the signed attestation, and the v2 voter signature also
covers the full credential, so a relay cannot attach a newer credential to an
older signed ballot.

**Eligibility = sole authority on voter weight.** It binds each voter's weight into the signed
`ATTESTATION_V1` (over `electionId, pseudonym, vk, weight, nonce`); the config only sets policy
(`weighted`, and a `scale` divisor applied to every weight at tally). Admission rejects
`weight < 1`. The
bundled stub grants a fixed `ELIGIBILITY_DUMMY_WEIGHT` (default 1); real weights come from the
integrator's source (token balance, registry, membership tier, …).

> **Production edge layer (required).** The bundled issuer is a dev stub on plain HTTP, called
> directly by voters' browsers. A real deployment MUST sit behind **TLS + a real DNS name** and
> a **reverse proxy (Caddy / nginx)** enforcing rate-limiting, request-size limits, and abuse
> protection on the unauthenticated `/attest`. `docker-compose.eligibility.yml` runs only the
> bare stub — add this layer yourself.

**Ballot gas & privacy (chain).** `submitVote` is `msg.sender`: **sponsor** (funded
`GATEWAY_SIGNING_KEY` on the ballot ingest) or **voters self-pay**. `selfSubmitFee` (per-election,
in the signed config) + `VOTE_PROXY_ROLE` tune the protocol fee; `selfSubmitFee = 0` is fee-free.
Self-submission exposes the submitting wallet address on-chain. Sponsored
submission keeps that address out of the transaction sender field. The bundled
HTTP issuer derives pseudonyms with a secret-keyed HMAC; the separate reference
wallet adapter uses `keccak256(address ‖ electionId)`, which anyone with a candidate
address can recompute. Sponsorship alone does not hide that adapter's identity link.
The issuer itself still knows which wallet requested each credential.

**Budget is bounded on the chain backend.** `submitVote` stores the whole ballot, and Variant A's
proof grows as `ℓ x (budget + 1)`, so at `ℓ = 3` a budget-100 ballot is ~78 KB — about **49M gas**
of storage against a 30M block limit. Casting fails with
`Out of gas: gas required exceeds allowance: 30000000`, which names the gas and not the cause.
For three candidates, budget 10 is much smaller than budget 100. Check transaction
gas against the target chain's block limit; these example limits are not universal.
Use the database backend for ballots too large to fit the target chain.

**Timing.** You choose the voting window **in the register form** (step 5) — for a quick demo
pick a short one (e.g. a couple of minutes out and a couple of minutes long), leaving enough
lead time for the DKG.

**DKG integrity & complaints.** Keyper→keyper DKG traffic is signed (dealers sign their
commitments and shares, verified against the config member address) and each secret share is
**sealed** to the recipient's X25519 key, so nothing secret is on the wire. If a keyper's
Feldman-VSS check rejects a dealer's share it returns a **signed accusation**, and the
coordinator runs a bounded repair loop: it asks the accused dealer to resend
the share and asks the recipient to verify it again. Keypers with verified shares
can still publish if another keyper keeps complaining. The ceremony fails when
no key finalises after repair; signed accusations are logged as `op=dkg_complaint`.
An election without a finalised key at voting start derives to `DKGFailed`. The accused dealer's `/dkg/reveal_share` sends a replacement share sealed to the
accusing recipient; the secret share is not returned to the coordinator.

**Tally ordering & bounds.** The tally runs in strict order and only after `voting_end`, enforced at
every layer: the coordinator drives it only in the `Tallying` state, keypers self-guard, and the data
layer **and** chain contract **reject** an aggregate submitted before `voting_end`, and a decryption
share submitted before `voting_end` **or before a canonical aggregate exists**. The sequence is
aggregate → gate on `t` byte-identical keyper submissions → decrypt → publish.
The default retry budget is five unsuccessful attempts per phase. Polls reporting
that a keyper is still computing an aggregate do not consume this budget. The
coordinator also checks a six-hour elapsed-time limit measured from `voting_end`
while waiting for an aggregate or shares. These are coordinator defaults, not
election configuration fields or a terminal protocol deadline. A tally that cannot proceed is
**abandoned** — logged as `op=tally status=abandoned` **and** surfaced on the dashboard as a red
**`TallyStalled`** badge (a persisted flag; the coordinator is the only writer of "stalled"). It's
recoverable but **not** self-healing: the persisted flag is authoritative, so a **coordinator
restart does NOT resume a stalled tally**. The only way out is the **Retry** button on the admin
panel — the admin wallet signs a `clearTallyStalled`, which the admin service relays; the
coordinator then resumes with a **fresh 5-attempt budget** (bring the keypers back online first,
or it just re-stalls). Retry resets the attempt counters, but does not move the
six-hour limit away from the original voting end; a retry after that limit can
stall again on its next incomplete poll. A published result always supersedes it (→ `Complete`). Integrity is
checked through ballot verification, the storage adapter's aggregate quorum rule
and DLEQ proofs for the decryption shares. The current keyper trusts the aggregate
returned by its data-layer read endpoint; see the
[README verification limits](./README.md#current-verification-limits).

**Admin auth.** Each register/cancel is authorized by the admin wallet's signature (no token);
the same EOA is the wallet, `config.admin_key`, and `ADMIN_SIGNING_KEY`. "Changing keypers" is
per new election — each config names its own committee; URLs travel in the config (on chain the
`KeyperSet` stores them), read through the port — no URL env var.

**Secret retention.** Keyper shares are retained for 90 days after voting end by
default (`KEYPER_SECRET_TTL_S=7776000`). A tally can no longer decrypt if too many
shares have been pruned. Set retention to match your recovery needs; `never`
disables automatic expiry.

**Rebuild after code changes:** re-run `up` with `--build`.

**Backend selection** via `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_DATA_LAYER`: `memory` (zero-dep local) · `database`
(`SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_DATA_LAYER_URL` for clients / `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_DATA_LAYER_DSN` for the service) · `blockchain`
(`SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_CHAIN_RPC`, `SHUTTER_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`, each actor's own key).
