"""Auditor procedure.

Anyone can audit an election from public reads alone: recompute DKG finalization
from the stored submissions, independently re-derive the admitted set and the
weighted aggregate, re-verify every decryption share's DLEQ, and recombine to
check the published result. Any mismatch is publishable evidence.
Detection is guaranteed even against a malicious data layer / gateway /
coordinator (v1 has no in-protocol challenge).

The result is **checked, not re-solved**: each published total is multiplied by the
generator and compared to the ``τ`` this audit derives itself. That is exactly as
conclusive as re-running BSGS — the discrete log is unique, so only the true total
satisfies the equality — and it costs one scalar multiplication per candidate
instead of an ``O(√bound)`` search holding a √bound-entry table. An auditor obliged
to re-solve could not audit a large election at all; see
``docs/COORDINATOR_SIZING.md``.
