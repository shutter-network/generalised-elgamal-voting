"""``PostgresStore`` — the database adapter's enforcement engine.

Implements the ``ElectionDataLayer`` contract against Postgres, server-side:
stable total ballot ordering (a per-election 0-based sequence assigned under a row
lock), config immutability after ``voting_start``, append-only artifacts and
idempotent shares (via primary keys + read-compare), the DKG finalization quorum
rule, the write-authorization matrix (:mod:`geg.authz` request signatures), and
public reads. It enforces the *same* contract as the in-memory reference and
passes the *same* conformance suite.

Time is injected via ``clock`` (the service's NTP-disciplined wall clock in
production; a controllable clock in tests) so immutability/cancellation windows
are deterministic — matching "the authoritative timestamp source is the adapter's"
.
