"""Fixed parameters of the protocol-v1 crypto suite.

BLS12-381: ElGamal ciphertexts and DKG artifacts live in **G2**; voter Schnorr
signatures and attestations live in **G1**. Scalars are integers mod
:data:`CURVE_ORDER`, serialized big-endian in 32 bytes. Hash is keccak256
throughout. Domain-separation tags and fixed byte sizes are pinned here because
they are the interop contract — changing any of them is a ``protocol_version``
bump, never an edit.

# ``BINDING_LABEL``; that transcript existed in four implementations across two

# challenge as a side effect, which is a bug: the two version for unrelated reasons.
# The message changed because the credential moved inside it; the proof still proves
# the same statement over the same public inputs and its domain never changed.

# was byte-identical to the *superseded message format* used by the v1 detection in
