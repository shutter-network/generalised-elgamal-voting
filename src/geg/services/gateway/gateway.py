"""Ballot admission (gateway) — library.

The single-ballot admission filter used by the public API's ballot ingest
(``POST /elections/<eid>/ballots``). Runs the standard admission verification as a
**filter (on by default)** and writes accepted ballots to the data layer. The
filter is for UX (a voter learns immediately that a ballot is malformed) and
spam/storage protection; its accept/reject decision has **no bearing on tally
correctness** — verification is authoritative at tally time, and a compromised
ingress (or a direct-submission path) can inject unverified rows without affecting
the tally.

Duplicate handling is NOT done here (it is evaluated at tally time over the full
ordered list); this only checks single-ballot validity and the voting window.

This module has no HTTP surface of its own: the ingest endpoint lives on the
``api`` service (``geg.services.api``), which imports :func:`submit_ballot`.

    and on the HTTP backend that is ``n/page`` network round trips *per vote*, which is a
    self-inflicted amplifier on a public endpoint.

    Backwards is the right direction: the issuer allocates nonces monotonically and voters
    submit in order, so a pseudonym's highest nonce is overwhelmingly among its latest
    ballots. Bounding the walk makes this **best-effort**, which it already was — a
    determined replayer could bury the newest ballot under ``_NONCE_SCAN_LIMIT`` others and
    slip a stale one past *this filter*. That costs nothing in integrity: the tally ranks
    duplicates by ``(nonce, sequence_number)`` in ``admit`` regardless of what got stored,
