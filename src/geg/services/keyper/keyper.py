"""Keyper service.

A committee member: participates in the fresh per-election DKG, re-derives and
submits the deterministic aggregate (canonical at the t+1 quorum), and produces
precondition-guarded partial decryptions of the canonical aggregate. Keypers are
triggered automatically by the coordinator but **never trust the trigger** — before
producing shares a keyper re-derives the necessary facts from the data layer itself
. Aggregate integrity comes from the **t+1 keyper quorum** (a bogus aggregate
can't become canonical under the threshold assumption), so decryption needs no
separate honesty re-check.

The DKG round exchange here is in-process (driven by the coordinator); a
multi-operator deployment wraps the same round methods behind authenticated P2P
HTTP, which is a transport concern, not a protocol one.
