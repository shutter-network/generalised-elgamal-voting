"""Write-authorization identities — secp256k1 / ecrecover.

Unified with the on-chain authorization model: a write identity is an **Ethereum
secp256k1 key**, its ``identity`` is the 20-byte address, and a write is
authorized by an EIP-191 signature that the verifier recovers with ``ecrecover``.
The same identity/signature works for the in-memory, database (verify by
``ecrecover``), and blockchain (relayed as a meta-tx the contract ``ecrecover``s)
data layers, so keypers/services are backend-agnostic.

This is defense-in-depth against spam, **not a trust anchor** — every stored
artifact is self-verifying. Voter **ballot** and **attestation** keys are
unrelated and remain Schnorr-G1 (see :mod:`geg.crypto`).

    The previous encoding joined the three fields with a ``b"|"`` separator and no

    ``("a", b"b", b"c|d")`` and ``("a", b"b|c", b"d")`` both produced ``keccak(b"a|b|c|d")``
