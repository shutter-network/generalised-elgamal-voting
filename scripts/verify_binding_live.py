"""Check every ballot in a live election carries a valid voter binding.

The binding is what ties a ballot to the credential it was cast with. Admission
already enforces it — a bad one is excluded as INVALID_ATTESTATION — but an
exclusion tells you a ballot was refused, not *why*, and a tally that silently
drops every ballot looks much like an eligibility misconfiguration. This checks
the property directly, against ballots the data layer actually served.

Read-only. Point it at whichever backend is running:

    python3 scripts/verify_binding_live.py --url http://localhost:8500/port \
        --election 0x<32-byte hex>

The `api` service mounts the read surface at `/port` (:8500 in the db stack); the
coordinator's own root surface (:8400) serves the full contract. Either works —
this only reads.
