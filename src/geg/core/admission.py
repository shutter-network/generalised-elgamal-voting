"""Ballot admission — the correctness kernel.

A deterministic function from the data layer's ordered ballot list + election
config + eligibility key to an **admitted set** and typed **exclusion reasons**.
This is the authoritative definition of which ballots the tally counts; each keyper
runs it to produce its aggregate submission, the auditor runs it to re-derive the
tally, and it is reproducible by anyone from public data alone.

Verification is authoritative here (at tally time), not at the gateway. Each
ballot is validated independently; then the duplicate policy is applied over the
still-valid ballots in the data layer's stable total order.

Reason precedence per ballot (first failure wins): ``MALFORMED`` (wrong-election
binding / structural) → ``OUT_OF_WINDOW`` → ``INVALID_ATTESTATION`` →
``INVALID_SIGNATURE`` / ``INVALID_PROOF``. ``DUPLICATE_PSEUDONYM`` is assigned
only among otherwise-valid ballots.
