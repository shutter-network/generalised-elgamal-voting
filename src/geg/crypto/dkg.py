"""Feldman VSS distributed key generation over G2.

Each keyper draws a random degree-``quorum - 1`` polynomial, publishes Feldman
commitments ``γ_j = c_j·P2``, and hands share ``φ(i)`` to keyper ``i``. In round 2
every keyper checks each received share against the dealer's commitments
(``s_i·P2 == Σ_j i^j·γ_j``) and, if all pass, forms its combined secret share
``msk_j = Σ_k s_j^(k)``. The joint key is ``mpk = Σ_k γ_0^(k) = msk·P2``.

Throughout this module ``quorum`` is the number of keypers required to decrypt — the
config's ``threshold.t``, which *is* the quorum. A quorum of ``q`` implies a
degree-``q-1`` polynomial with ``q`` coefficients, hence exactly ``q`` Feldman
commitments, so that any ``q`` shares Lagrange-interpolate the secret.

A fresh DKG runs per election; there is no long-lived master key.
