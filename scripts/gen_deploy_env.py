"""Generate a consistent deployment identity set (env files only).

**Local / testing convenience — NOT a production tool.** It mints ALL identities
(including the keypers' private keys) in one place so a single machine can run the
whole stack for demos and the RUNNING.md walkthroughs. A real deployment does the
opposite: each keyper operator holds their own key on their own machine and only
shares their address, and the admin fills a real ``deploy/.env`` from ``.env.example``
by hand. Do not use the keys this emits for anything real — they are throwaway.

Its reason to exist is *coherence*: these secp256k1 identities are cross-referential
and hand-authoring them consistently is error-prone — each keyper's
``KEYPER_SIGNING_KEY`` must match the address the admin registers (the form resolves it
from the keyper's ``/status``), the coordinator's key must produce the
``COORDINATOR_IDENTITY`` keypers pin, and the eligibility private key must match the
eligibility *public* key the admin enters in the register form. This wires it up in one
shot:

    python scripts/gen_deploy_env.py

Writes (under ``deploy/``, relative to repo root):
  * ``.env``               — admin/operator-stack keys + tokens (the coordinator key
                             doubles as the chain relayer + result publisher)
  * ``.env.keyper{1,2,3}`` — one self-contained env per keyper stack (its key, pinned
                             coordinator address, port, state dir)
  * ``.env.eligibility``   — the eligibility issuer's env (its private key + service
                             config), run with its own ``--env-file``

The election is registered through the admin frontend — this script does NOT emit a
config. The values the admin types into the register form (operator addresses + the
eligibility public key) are printed to stdout and noted in the env files.
