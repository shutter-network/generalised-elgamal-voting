"""Deployable keyper HTTP service (geg ports).

One process per committee member. Wraps the keyper crypto (`KeyperDKGState`,
partial decryption) behind an authenticated HTTP API the DKG coordinator drives,
with confidential round-2 shares travelling **directly keyper→keyper**. Secrets
persist encrypted at rest (:mod:`geg.services.keyper_persistence`) so the process
survives the gap between DKG and decryption.

Auth (fail-closed until bootstrapped): coordinator→keyper endpoints require the
``api_token``; keyper→keyper (`/dkg/receive_*`) require the callee's ``peer_token``;
``/status``, ``/health``, ``/auth/bootstrap`` are open. Tokens are installed via a
one-time X25519-sealed + coordinator-signed :func:`/auth/bootstrap` and persisted.

DKG peer-to-peer traffic is authenticated **and** confidential: dealers EIP-191-sign
their commitments and shares (verified against the dealer's config member address), and
each secret share travels **sealed** to the recipient's X25519 key — published and
self-bound on ``/status`` as ``encryptionPubkey`` / ``encryptionPubkeySig`` so a relayed
key is verified against the member address before anyone seals to it. A Feldman-VSS
complaint at ``/dkg/round2`` returns recipient-signed ``DKG-ACCUSE-v1`` accusations; the
accused dealer's ``/dkg/reveal_share`` discloses a share **only** on such an accusation
from that share's own recipient (so a caller can never harvest others' shares).
A complaint is then **repaired, not fatal**: ``/dkg/reveal_share`` re-seals the disputed
share straight to its recipient (never to the caller), the recipient accepts it only if it
verifies against the dealer's commitments, and round 2 is re-run for that keyper. The ceremony proceeds
as long as a quorum can publish, so no single member can veto key generation.

The server never trusts a decryption trigger — `/publish_decr_share` re-checks the
preconditions against the data layer (via :class:`KeyperService`). There is deliberately
no oracle that partial-decrypts a caller-supplied ciphertext.

        the rule that shares never traverse the coordinator. The caller now learns only
        *that* a re-deal happened.

        The recipient accepts the re-dealt share as a replacement only if it verifies
        against this dealer's published commitments, so this cannot be used to inject a bad

        it then read as a failed attempt and, after five polls, as a stalled tally — on a
        keyper that was working perfectly. It also blocked every *other* election, because
        the coordinator scans sequentially.

        So: preconditions are checked synchronously (cheap, and a real refusal should still
        be a 409), then the work moves to a background thread. The status tells the
        coordinator whether to keep waiting:

        * ``200 submitted``   — this keyper has already contributed

        divergence (one keyper read the ballot list a moment earlier than another — common
        on chain while a late vote is still confirming). Only the coordinator can see "all
        submitted, still no quorum", so only it asks; a keyper re-deriving on its own every
