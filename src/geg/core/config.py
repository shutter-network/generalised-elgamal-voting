"""Election configuration and lifecycle enums.

The election-configuration table. The config is
registered once by the admin service and is **immutable after ``voting_start``**
(the data-layer adapter enforces this: free on the contract adapter, mandatory
server-side on the database adapter).

Every field here is a pure datum; nothing in this module performs I/O or crypto.
Identities (``eligibility_key``, ``result_publisher_key``, ``gateway_keys``,
``admin_key``, and each keyper's signing identity) are opaque ``bytes`` — the
data-layer adapter decides how to interpret them (a 20-byte Ethereum address on
the chain adapter, a 48-byte compressed-G1 key on a signature-checking database
adapter, etc.). The core protocol only compares them for equality.
